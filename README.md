# InfectionSpreading.jl
This module was specially developed for a Bachelor degree thesis in [Computer Science @ UniRoma2](http://www.informatica.uniroma2.it), inspired by the work done in [arXiv:2103.16398](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16398).

This module is used to carry out simulations regarding the infections spreading on more complex social network models than those exhaustively analyzed in the article, with the aim of researching the existence of other thresholds.

Documentation on how to use the module will come soon...
